        // Dialog
        "Script_1_Opening_1" "Oh look at this! New blood! The dragon knight himself!"
        "Script_1_Opening_2" "Fresh from the Netflix anime are you? Welcome to the world of Dota 2! We are here to teach you how to navigate the best game ever made."
        "Script_1_Opening_3" "Except for Artifact."
        "Script_1_Opening_4" "Yes, yes, of course, except for Artifact."
        "General_Boo" "*Boo*"
        "Script_1_Opening_5" "First things first, let's take you through the main goals of the game, Defense of the Ancients."
        "Script_1_Opening_6" "Is it to defend the ancients by any chance?"
        "Script_1_Opening_7" "No, surprisingly, it is to kill the enemy Ancient. See, this is why you need us."
        "Script_1_Opening_8" "This is the Dota 2 map, your personal battlefield. You are currently in your fountain. It will heal you and is where you can purchase items, which are power ups for your hero."
        "Script_1_Opening_9" "This is also where you will respawn after you die, which I'm sure is coming up very soon."
        "Script_1_Opening_10" "This, all the way over here, is the enemy ancient, this is what you are trying to destroy."
        "Script_1_Opening_11" "But we have a long way to go before that."
        "Script_1_Movement_1" "So, let's start off with baby steps. Let's get you to move. Move your cursor over this very generic tutorial-type waypoint and then click the right mouse button to move your hero."
        "Script_1_Movement_2" "That’s mean, I think it looks pretty."
        "Script_1_Movement_3" "You would. Something as ugly as you would think that.. BROTHER."
        "Script_1_Movement_4" "Oh my goodness its first steps! SOMEONE GRAB THE CAMERA!"
        "Script_1_Movement_5" "OK, now move on to the next arrow. Oh hey, it’s Mirana, from the anime - but with a budget voice actress!"
        "Script_1_Movement_6" "Actually she’s a very old hero, in fact, she was in the original Dota."
        "Script_1_Movement_7" "Mirana from the anime!"
        "Script_1_Movement_8" "Anyway, she’s very protective of us for some reason. Watch out for her arrows. Simply dodge them when she fires at you."
        "Script_1_Movement_9" "Hello! I'm Mirana."
        "Script_1_Movement_9_1" "Miiiiiranaaa!"
        "Script_1_Movement_10" "Nice dodging."
        "Script_1_Movement_10_1" "Don't get hit! Oh."
        "Script_1_Movement_10_2" "Sorry was that you? My bad!"
        "Script_1_Movement_11" "That's a good effort! Very good you are a real walking pro. Now, let's get to the hard stuff. I am going to unlock your camera now. If at any point you get lost, the 'F1' key will bring you back to your hero."
        "Script_1_Camera_1" "Whoa whoa where are you goin'?! This guy's out of his mind! Reel it back in kiddo."
        "Script_1_Camera_2" "In the game of Dota, you will need to move your camera while simultaneously moving your hero to a selected spot. This is difficult to master but is step one. We will help you, but first we need to get you ready to fight if you want to survive outside of the safety of your fountain."
        "Script_1_Camera_3" "Here is a target dummy."
        "Ogre_Spawn" "Spawn Line"
        "Script_1_Camera_5" "This is the new player that showed up yesterday! He didn't make it past the movement part. Hover your mouse over the dummy and right click him to attack!"
        "Ogre_Die" "Dying Line"
        "Script_1_Camera_7" "Oh my that was very violent. Wait, why do I have a health bar over my head now?"
        "Script_1_Camera_8" "Come on you know you want to. Do it. Attack the man."
        "Script_1_Camera_9" "AUGGGGHH WHYYY WHY GOD IT HURTS!"
        "Script_1_Camera_10" "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!"
        "Script_1_Leveling_1" "Oh look at that you leveled up and got a ton of gold! Killing enemies, or just being in the general area of killed enemies allows you to gain experience and gold. Gaining experience allows you to level up, like in an RPG game. As you can see, you were already provided your third skill, Dragon Blood, which is a passive, meaning it just works. Now, you can select another skill! Let’s have you select an active ability. Click on the plus sign over Dragon Tail."
        "Script_1_Leveling_2" "Feel free to hover over your skills at any time, to learn more about them. Probably best not to do this during the game though as other people might laugh at you. You can also read up on all the hero skills in the heroes tab, which is in the main menu of Dota."
        "Script_1_Leveling_3" "Oh no, here comes Pugna. He's so annoying."
        "Script_1_Leveling_4" "Yellow everybody this is Pugna and I'm here to talk to you today about the difference between strength, agility, and intelligence."
        "Script_1_Leveling_4_2" "LONG MONOLOGUE"
        "Script_1_Leveling_5" "Oh no, make him stop! Use your ability! Press the 'W' key or hover over the icon and then select the skill that you'd like to use. Then hover the mouse over the enemy unit and left click them."
        "Script_1_Leveling_6" "Great! Your hero will automatically walk toward the enemy until the spell is in casting range, and then they will automatically cast it!"
        "Script_1_Leveling_7" "Please don’t interrupt me."
        "Script_1_Leveling_8" "Oh no ahhh."
        "General_Cheer" "*Cheer*"
        "Script_1_Leveling_9" "Excellent work! I'm a ghost now by the way! Looks like you got enough exp for another level! Try putting it in your Breathe Fire ability!"
        "Script_1_Leveling_10" "Your Dragon Tail is a single target ability, meaning you can target an enemy and it will cast it on them, as long as you are in range. Breathe Fire on the other hand, is a target point ability, meaning you can target a point, like a place on the map, but not a specific unit."
        "Script_1_BreatheFire_1" "Wait, why do I have a health bar?"
        "Script_1_BreatheFire_2" "It’s your turn, dear brother. you know what to do young one. Press 'Q', aka your Breathe Fire ability, or simply select it with your mouse, then click on the ground with the left mouse button in the direction you want to cast."
        "Script_1_BreatheFire_3" "No NO NO!!"
        "Script_1_BreatheFire_3_failed" "Oh, I see you missed. OK, I'll refresh it. Give it another go!"
        "Script_1_BreatheFire_4" "AHHHH IT BURNS...welp guess we are both ghosts now."
        "Script_1_BreatheFire_5" "Yes both ghosts, here to haunt you for eternity. Just keep in mind that this is NOT in a normal dota game. You will not be haunted by ghosts I promise. You know what else will haunt you? Hit the shop button!"
        "Script_1_Shop_1" "Oh my god there are so many items! MY EYES!"
        "Script_1_Shop_2" "Items are one of the many reasons this game is so deep. A hero by default, will be good at a specific thing depending on who you pick. But items allow you to change them to excel in areas they may not be able to normally."
        "Script_1_Shop_3" "Certain items can allow you to open up completely different playstyles for your heroes. Think of Dota heroes as rock, paper, scissors. Rock will always beat scissors, but in Dota, scissors can specifically build itself to be a little better against rock, should the need arise."
        "Script_1_Shop_4" "Don't worry my friend. Every single hero has a guide that the community made which will tell you with items to buy on them. This is a little video that will show you how to do this in game. Select a guide-maker that you like and trust, and select their guide and confirm them."
        "Script_1_Shop_5" "Speaking of which, I made you a guide to get out of this exact scenario right now. You can trust me... trust me."
        "Script_1_Shop_7" "Now as you can see in my guide we have items here and you can just click on them if you have enough gold. You don't have to find them in the big shop list. Your gold is down in the bottom right. Congratulations! I think you have enough money from murdering 3 people in the very short time you've arrived here, so go ahead and buy that Tango."
        "Script_1_Closing_1" "OK creature of mine, it's time for you to escape this hellish prison we have designed for you. Click on the item in your inventory, just like you would a spell, and then click select one of the trees. Are you starting to see a pattern?"
        "Script_1_Closing_2" "Yeah, I hope so."
        "Script_1_Closing_3" "You did it! Don’t ask why eating a tree is a good thing in this game, it just is. You can now escape! Go little one run before we change our minds!"
        "Script_1_Closing_4" "We are going to give you back control over your camera. It's time to walk and look baby. Good luck!"
        "Script_1_Closing_5" "Did you really think we would just let you out? NO! WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF BARRIERS."
        "General_Scared" "*Scared*"
        "Script_1_Closing_6" "Go baby infant! Follow this very not ominous path! Practice your moving and camera control! Keep in mind that you can move your camera in two ways. Number one is for cool people: where you middle click your mouse on the ground and hold it while dragging. Or you can be like my idiot greevil brother, and move your cursor to the edge of the screen. All of this of course you can change in your game settings."
        "Script_2_Opening_1" "And here we are. Welcome to the top radiant barracks. Before you lay several buildings each with their own purpose and destiny."
        "Script_2_Opening_2" "Except for that one there. That’s a Moon Well."
        "Script_2_Opening_3" "Yes that is just there to look cool. Do you think it's cool? I do."
        "Script_2_Opening_4" "Very good. So, to your right you can see the Melee Barracks, and to the left you see the Ranged Barracks. These two buildings spawn creeps!"
        "Script_2_Opening_5" "Don't worry, not creeps like people that have bodypillows. Creeps like... uh... what are the creeps like?"
        "Script_2_Opening_6" "The creeps spawn every 30 seconds and walk down the path ahead of them, called a lane. The creeps are uncontrollable and have one mission, to mindlessly walk down the path and attack any enemy they come in contact with. This includes enemy heroes, buildings, or emotions!"
        "Script_2_Opening_7" "That's right. The creeps act as your cannon fodder, making sure that the enemy can't just go to your side of the map and hurt you, or they will be stabbed by a thousand little swords."
        "Script_2_Opening_8" "These Barracks are what spawn these creeps, so as you can imagine if you destroy the enemy’s Barracks, then your creeps become stronger. That may not make sense, but that’s just how Dota is. There is one set of barracks in each of the three lanes. These lanes are referred to as Top, Middle, and Bottom."
        "Script_2_Opening_9" "Now, if you destroy the Barracks, the enemy creeps don't just stop spawning. They continue to spawn, but your creeps get stronger in each lane that lacks an enemy Barracks. Take one lane and you'll get SUPER creeps. And if you take all of the lanes, you get MEGA creeps. Check out how different the creeps are and how much more powerful they get as they murder these poor innocent heroes."
        "Script_2_Opening_9_1" "That mega creep don't mess around!"
        "Script_2_Opening_10" "Indeed! Think of Dota like this: killing other players allows you to have time to hit their buildings while they respawn. Hitting buildings is the true goal of dota, for when there are no buildings the enemy ancient is exposed. The game in a nutshell is essentially an elaborate tug of war where both sides try to outpush the other."
        "Script_2_Opening_11" "Yes. Well that technically would be the opposite of a tug of war."
        "Script_2_Opening_12" "Quiet you!"
        "Script_2_Opening_13" "Dota is a game about creeps, and exposing things. This is actually not a joke!"
        "Script_2_Creeps_1" "So the creeps have now connected and are fighting each other. As you can see, whenever an enemy unit dies, you will gain experience as long as you are in the general area. Whether you kill the unit or not, you will still get experience."
        "Script_2_Creeps_2" "But in order to get gold, YOU must be the one to get the killing blow. We call this a last hit. This concept works for anything killable in Dota, including buildings."
        "Script_2_Creeps_3" "Alright, try getting some last hits on some of these creeps. And to help coach you, let me introduce you to our last hit trainer. No, it's not minigame, it's an Australian golem."
        "Script_2_Creeps_4" "Howdy dragon man, it's nice to meet you."
        "Script_2_Creeps_5" "Oh, that was a good last hit!"
        "Script_2_Creeps_6" "You got it, you got it. Keep it up."
        "Script_2_Creeps_7" "You're a goddam natural."
        "Script_2_Creeps_8" "Yeesh. You hit some you miss some."
        "Script_2_Creeps_9" "Hey hey now that's a lot of gold you're missing."
        "Script_2_Creeps_10" "Are you doing this on purpose?"
        "Script_2_Creeps_11" "Depending on your hero, you can also use spells to kill creeps. Just keep in mind that this will cost you a very precious commodity. Remember, auto attacking costs you nothing, but spells typically use a resource called mana, which is your blue bar. Go ahead and get a kill with Breathe Fire."
        "Script_2_Creeps_12" "So long Dragon Knight. Don't give up!"
        "Script_2_Creeps_13" "And look who we have here, an enemy hero!"
        "Script_2_Creeps_14" "This is Sniper, you will probably see a lot of him in your games. Everyone really hates him."
        "Script_2_Creeps_15" "Your hero Dragon Knight is a melee hero, which typically means you will be a bit tankier than ranged heroes like Sniper. But of course the downside to being melee, is you gotta get closer in order to attack."
        "Script_2_Creeps_16" "Lock, stock n' barrel."
        "Script_2_Creeps_17" "Get outta my lane. These are my last hits."
        "Script_2_Creeps_18" "Nuh uh! You suck."
        "Script_2_Creeps_18_1" "Come on! You can do better than that."
        "Script_2_Creeps_18_2" "Hm, not that bad... for a dragon."
        "Script_2_Creeps_18_3" "Okay, okay."
        "Script_2_Creeps_19" "As you can see, Sniper is actually getting the last hit on some of his own creeps. Why would someone ever do such a thing?"
        "Script_2_Creeps_20" "This is called denying. When an allied creep is at low health, you can actually attack it by hitting the 'A' key and selecting your creep. If you get the last hit then the enemy will actually get less experience. This is what separates us from the plebians over at League."
        "Script_2_Creeps_21" "Try denying some of your creeps now."
        "Script_2_Creeps_22" "Great, you’ve denied some creeps, which means Sniper is less powerful than you right now. Take advantage of this by destroying him."
        "Script_2_Creeps_23" "Yes, do the community a favor and kill that mother fucker."
        "Script_2_Creeps_24" "Ooooh shit!"
        "Script_2_Creeps_25" "Please, I have a family!"
        "Script_2_Tower_1" "Now that that filth sniper has died, push his tower."
        "Script_2_Tower_2" "Towers are an important objective. Each lane has a few of them for protection. Once you’ve killed one, it’s gone forever. Go ahead and try to destroy that tower. Doing so is the same versus any other unit in the game. You can simply right click it to attack."
        "Script_2_Tower_3" "And now you know the pain of death. Let this be an important lesson for you. Pushing towers can be very dangerous."
        "Script_2_Tower_4" "As you can see, you are now dead. But luckily for you, death is not permanent, unlike for us greevils. Your respawn timer can be seen at the top hud or your personal hero portrait. You will always respawn in the fountain."
        "Script_2_Tower_5" "Your respawn time is based on how much experience you have. The longer the game goes, the longer your respawn time will be. Luckily for us, you are a noob, so it should be no time at all"
        "Script_2_Tower_6" "Even though you’re dead, you can still be valuable to your team by overseeing the map in order to make the best decisions in the game. Example being where should you go next? Or what item does an enemy have? What is the meaning of life? All these things can be learned while you’re dead."
        "Script_2_Tower_7" "Time to go back to the tower. Typically you’d need an item to teleport there, but I’m bored, so let's help you out a bit!"
        "Script_2_Tower_8" "This time, let’s be more cautious. Every tower has a radius in which they will start attacking enemy units. Hold the Alt button, to see how big that is."
        "Script_2_Tower_9" "As you can see, when the creeps enter the area of the tower, it started attacking the first target it sees. This can allow you to move within the tower’s range without getting hit. OK, try getting to the other side of the tower without taking damage."
        "Script_2_Tower_10" "Good, now get back to your side."
        "Script_2_Tower_11" "Start killing the tower. Just remember that towers typically only attack 1 unit at a time, so just use your creeps to tank it up for you."
        "Script_2_Tower_12" "OK, you are actually pretty weak, so lets level you up to 6, which will provide you with your ultimate ability. In addition, we’ll gladly provide you some late game items."
        "Script_2_Tower_13" "Damn you are strong now! Activate your ultimate, which turns you into a DRAGON!"
        "Script_2_Tower_14" "Doing so will actually turn you into a ranged hero, pretty cool huh?"
        "Script_2_Tower_15" "Now kill that tower!"
        "Script_2_Tower_16" "The enemy just activated their glyph. It will temporarily make all their towers and creeps invulnerable for a short amount of time. Go ahead and try clicking it yourself!"
        "Script_2_Tower_17" "Nicely done. Now destroy the tower once and for all!"
        "Script_2_Tower_18" "You’ll notice we have deleted your items. Don’t actually do this in a match or you will get reported!"
        "Script_2_Courier_1" "Now that you’ve killed some creeps and a tier 1 tower, lets go actually buy some items for yourself."
        "Script_2_Courier_2" "As we mentioned previously, most items can be bought from your base, but there are actually some items you can only buy from the Secret Shop."
        "Script_2_Courier_3" "Your minimap will show the 2 locations of this shop. Go ahead and move over there to purchase some goodies. If you want to go to a specific spot on the map without having to follow your hero with the camera, you can use the mini map! Right click on the secret shop and your hero will walk there automatically!"
        "Script_2_Courier_4" "There is a powerful damage item called the Deadelus. It gives you a bunch of plus damage, as well as a percentage chance to critical strike for even more. In order to build it, you need the Demon Edge, which is only available in the Secret shop. Go ahead and purchase that."
        "Script_2_Courier_5" "In order to complete the daedalus, you must purchase the Crystalys and recipe from the main shop. Go ahead and do so."
        "Script_2_Courier_6" "Keep in mind that for the regular shop, you can buy things from anywhere on the map. When you do this, just know that the items will not automatically enter your inventory. You will need to pick them up manually or have them delivered."
        "Script_2_Courier_7" "Ok, now I don’t know about you, but walking back to base seems like a huge waste of time. Luckily you can use your cuddly courier to deliver those items from base directly to you."
        "Script_2_Courier_8" "Everyone starts with a cute little courier. After you buy items, you can click on this arrow and it will tell your courier to bring you all the items which you purchased."
        "Script_2_Courier_9" "Now just hit the deliver button on the courier and it will come straight to you!"
        "Script_2_Courier_10" "Congratulations, you’ve successfully used a poor defenseless animal to do your bidding."
        "Script_2_Courier_11" "These little critters can die, so if you see an enemy courier, make sure to slay it! This gives your whole team gold and lets you slow down their progress!"
        "Script_2_Courier_12" "OK, you have some items, you have some levels, it's time for you to enter the terrifying world away from the lanes. Let's go into the jungle!"
        "Script_2_Courier_13" "Use your minimap to navigate to the waypoint, and lets get in there!"
        "Script_3_Opening_1" "You made it! Welcome to the terrifying dark jungle young innocent beautiful one! On the Dota map, there are three lanes. This is where most of the action takes place, as you will need to push one of these lanes, or more likely all of them, to win the game. Lanes are where creeps go, and that means it’s where the easy money and experience lies."
        "Script_3_Opening_2" "But not all things are so predictable my friend. The dark regions between the lanes, we call the jungle. Dangerous creatures spawn in the jungle in camps, where they stand guard to attack any who do them harm."
        "Script_3_Opening_3" "The jungle acts as a place where you can be unseen by your enemies. This means that you can farm here and make money or you could invade and they won't see you coming. Although, the same applies to them. But what are you farming? Well, let's show off some of those jungle creeps."
        "Script_3_Opening_5" "Jungle creeps come in 4 sizes, small, medium large, and ancients. Don’t get that confused with THE ancient of course. As you might imagine, the higher tier the jungle creeps, the bigger and stronger they are! But the bigger they are, the more gold and experience they will provide."
        "Script_3_Opening_6" "Go ahead and mercilessly slay this camp."
        "Script_3_Opening_7" "Good! Now all we need to do is wait! Jungle creeps spawn every minute. You’ll notice a clock at the top center of your screen."
        "Script_3_Opening_8" "I'm bored."
        "Script_3_Opening_9" "OK we will just respawn them now. But remember, every minute in the game!"
        "Script_3_Opening_10" "Great! But oh dear, these weak, pathetic creeps from the small camp give so little gold and experience."
        "Script_3_Opening_11" "You know, we could just walk to the bigger camp."
        "Script_3_Opening_12" "No, I'm far too fat to do that. I have a better idea! The jungle camps respawn every minute, so long as there is nothing in their spawn area. Hold the 'ALT' button to see what this spawn area looks like!"
        "Script_3_Opening_13" "See that box? You don’t want to stand in there when the in game timer reaches a minute, or you will block the spawn. Or, maybe you do want to stand in there, to block your enemies' camp from spawning! Kinda down to what kind of person you are."
        "Script_3_Opening_14" "Now, the creeps won't spawn if something is in their way. But what if we just move these creeps out of the way, at the exact moment that they are supposed to spawn? Let's see what happens! When the game timer hits 53, I want you to attack a jungle creep, then run away. Get them to chase you and make sure you are all out of the box before the timer hits zero!"
        "Script_3_Opening_15" "Ready?! Go!"
        "Script_3_Opening_16" "NO NO, TRY AGAIN. Pull at 53, then get out of the box."
        "Script_3_Opening_17" "Perfection! Well done! This is what we call stacking a camp. Now you can get much more xp and gold from slaying this camp. In fact, Dota rewards you for doing this by giving the person who stacked the camp additional gold just for bothering to do this!"
        "Script_3_Opening_18" "Yes, it’s an important skill for all heroes to know. So, lets see how good you are. Slay these creeps, and then let's try it again. But this time I want you to keep stacking the camp as many times as you can! Just like in the real game, you will need to pull the creeps earlier and earlier if you hope to stack more. The more you stack, the better gift I shall bestow upon you! And here’s someone to hype it for you. Good luck!"
        "Script_3_Opening_19" "We're here at the stacking training championships and I'm here to make this mundane activity extremely exciting."
        "Script_3_Opening_20" "That is not a stack. The judges are not gonna be happy."
        "Script_3_Opening_20_1" "If these stacks keep going like this, we're gonna have to direct you to play Lea...uuuh, another video game."
        "Script_3_Opening_21" "Double stack! Incredible."
        "Script_3_Opening_22" "Triple stack! Unbelievable."
        "Script_3_Opening_23" "Oh my go... oh my, that's a quad stack!"
        "Script_3_Opening_24" "Quintuple stack! Quintuple stack!"
        "Script_3_Opening_25" "Now that's what I like to call a sexy-tuple stack. Okay great. You can stack. Now go and do the other 9,999,999 things that you need to do before you can actually play the game. Okay, let's move on."
        "Script_3_Opening_25_1" "Look, I was told this would be a nice short little bit of the tutorial and it doesn't seem to have an end. So please, stop. I'm... I'm done with this, so are you, well done, you can stack, excellent, now let's go... let's go to the next bit."
        "Script_3_Opening_26" "Excellent work! Now, go ahead and clear this camp. You can leave it for your allies in the game if you want, but be careful if you do, there's little to stop an enemy from taking your stacked camp as well!"
        "Script_3_Neutrals_1" "By god, is that a NEUTRAL ITEM? I don't know why I'm acting so excited, they’re not particularly rare. Neutral items are dropped only by jungle creeps. Four of them will drop for each team based on the time of the in-game clock."
        "Script_3_Neutrals_2" "There are five tiers to these items and they get better as the game goes on. This whole process begins at 7 minutes for tier 1 items and ends with the most powerful and game breaking neutral items at 60 minutes!"
        "Script_3_Neutrals_3" "Yes, indeed! I’m sure you were thinking to yourself, there just aren’t enough items for me to learn in this game! Well here you are my friend. The good news is that your inventory has 1 slot that is reserved specifically for a neutral item, so you don’t have to mix and match with what you're buying during the game."
        "Script_3_Neutrals_4" "Uh no, what’s this? A new jungle camp?"
        "Script_3_Neutrals_5" "KILL IT!"
        "Script_3_Neutrals_6" "Dear me, you have 2 neutral items now! As you can see, the second neutral item went into your backpack. The backpack slots are what we call muted, meaning it’s as if you dont even have them on your hero. This is useful when your 6 item slots are full, but you still want some other items that you can swap out for. Anyway, let's send your first neutral item back to base."
        "Script_3_Neutrals_7" "Here is your neutral item."
        "Script_3_Neutrals_8" "Now right click on that, and select 'Send back to fountain'."
        "Script_3_Neutrals_9" "Great! Now your allies can take the garbage you don’t want. Please drag and drop the neutral item in your backpack with the left mouse button and put it into your neutral slot."
        "Script_3_Neutrals_10" "Congratulations! You have successfully swapped neutral items!"
        "Script_3_Neutrals_11" "You stacked camps, you farmed neutrals, you returned neutrals to the fountain. You are literally better than 80% of current Dota players."
        "Script_3_Neutrals_12" "OK then my little pancake. You have done so well, but it is time for you to grow up and become an adult version of whatever gender you identify as. It’s time to teach you how to kill."
        "Script_3_Neutrals_13" "What's up *Bleep*?"
        "Script_3_Neutrals_14" "It’s Riki! The demon rat! Follow that monster!"
        "Script_4_Opening_1" "OK, we just saw an enemy in the jungle. It is time to hunt them! But first, let’s talk about vision."
        "Script_4_Opening_2" "To have the best chance of killing someone, my friend, you must see them first. The fog of war covers all areas of the map where you lack vision."
        "Script_4_Opening_3" "As you can see here, you may be able to see the terrain, but if there are any enemies here you will not be able to see them without vision."
        "Script_4_Opening_4" "Look at these creeps. See how when they walk, the fog of war is lifted? Any friendly units, such as your creeps, your buildings, your allies, and of course, YOU will pierce the fog of war."
        "Script_4_Opening_5" "But like everything in Dota, it’s not that simple. You can only have vision in your line of sight. So if you are standing on the low ground of a hill, like we are now, you will not be able to see the high ground."
        "Script_4_Opening_6" "DON'T TRY IT!"
        "Script_4_Opening_7" "The same goes for all these trees. If you can put an object in-between an enemy and yourself, then they will lose vision of you, and you can potentially escape them!"
        "Script_4_Opening_8" "We call that there a JUKE!"
        "Script_4_Opening_9" "OK, with all that out of the way, now we know that Riki could be right at the top of this hill, and he could see us. Let's make sure with a scan!"
        "Script_4_Opening_10" "Behold the scan icon."
        "Script_4_Opening_11" "You can use a scan to click anywhere on your minimap and check to see if enemies are in that area, without vision! Try scanning here!"
        "Script_4_Opening_12" "Click on scan with your left mouse button, then click on the target."
        "Script_4_Opening_13" "Ah, no enemies there. When an enemy is under the scan, it will turn red and make an alarm sound!"
        "Script_4_Opening_14" "Usually the scan will go on cooldown for a while, but we will keep it available just for you. Scan again, but at the highground where we are! This will also be a test to see if you can find yourself on the minimap!"
        "Script_4_Opening_15" "That is a scan, but we want you to scan around where we are. See that arrow on your mini map? That's you! Scan right in front of you, where the arrow is pointing. That's the direction you are facing!"
        "Script_4_Opening_16" "Oh my goodness, the enemy is right up that hill! What should we do?"
        "Script_4_Opening_17" "Charge up blindly with no plan?"
        "Script_4_Opening_18" "That's what most idiots would do, but not us! We are going to use VISION! Behold, the most important item in the game.. the ward."
        "Script_4_Wards_1" "Go pick those up and come back here."
        "Script_4_Wards_2" "Wards are typically bought in the shop like a regular item. They give you vision in an area, even when no friendly units are there. They can be put on the high ground to give the best vision in the game! Wards are very important, as they can reveal what is lurking in the dark areas of the map."
        "Script_4_Wards_3" "Perhaps revealing enemies, so you can kill them."
        "Script_4_Wards_4" "And you can use wards defensively in your own jungle, so you can see when the enemy is coming!"
        "Script_4_Wards_5" "So they can't kill you!"
        "Script_4_Wards_6" "Now I know what you're thinking, the map is huge! Where should I put my wards? Well, good news friend, the best ones are already marked."
        "Script_4_Wards_7" "These cliffs marked with the eye symbol are some of the best places to put wards in the game. They provide good vision, are in vital choke points on the map, and can be used offensively and defensively."
        "Script_4_Wards_8" "OK, let's put a ward on this high ground before we just walk up there to our deaths. Select the ward in your inventory with the left mouse button, then click on the high ground target. This will place the ward. You don't need to be very close to do it."
        "Script_4_Wards_9" "Well done! But what's this? There is no one here! This can't be right, we scanned this area and it said someone was here? Are the scans lying? Is nothing real?"
        "Script_4_Wards_10" "Calm down friend. Now go pick up that odd blue ward."
        "Script_4_Wards_11" "Notice that it combines with your other ward in your inventory. Please double click on your ward in your inventory"
        "Script_4_Wards_12" "This blue ward is called a Sentry Ward. Its job is to show invisible things. This includes wards, and other units that are invisible! Place your blue Sentry Ward down on top of your yellow Observer Ward, just like you did last time. Click on the ward with the left mouse button, and then click on the map to place it in on the target."
        "Script_4_Wards_13" "HOLY SHIT!"
        "Script_4_Wards_14" "AH HA! There he is! Go and attack him! Click on him with your right mouse button!"
        "Script_4_Wards_15" "Oh nooo, he left the area of your sentry! Hold 'ALT' to see the area of effect your sentry has."
        "Script_4_Outpost_1" "Looks like we will need to hunt him down. Here is a Dust of Appearance!"
        "Script_4_Outpost_2" "Pick that up, and walk in the direction you saw Riki."
        "Script_4_Outpost_3" "Now hit the dust and hope he's close!"
        "Script_4_Outpost_4" "There he is! Get that pile of garbage!"
        "Script_4_Outpost_5" "Oh no, we lost him again. Maybe this time for good. Oh, one last idea. Let's take that enemy Outpost!"
        "Script_4_Outpost_6" "This structure is the enemy Outpost. The outpost, when under your control, gives you vision, both regular and truesight vision, which is what we use to see those invisible units. You can take the enemy Outpost only after you take a Tier 2 tower, which is the second tower in any lane."
        "Script_4_Outpost_7" "It didn't used to be like that but trust me it was annoying."
        "Script_4_Outpost_8" "Yes indeed. Anyway, right click on the enemy Outpost to take it."
        "Script_4_Outpost_9" "QUICK! THERE HE IS! KILL HIM!"
        "Script_4_Outpost_10" "That's one more invis spamming bastard down!"
        "Script_4_Outpost_11" "Great work. The Outpost also gives you a place to teleport to, and will give your entire team experience every 10 minutes! Try to make sure you control both Outposts, yours and your enemies', before each 10 minute interval on the in game clock!"
        "Script_4_Communication_1" "Oh my goodness! You killed Riki! Thank you so much, great job!"
        "Script_4_Communication_2" "Oh dear, this is one of your teammates! Don't worry they can't hear us, we are ghosts that only haunt you!"
        "Script_4_Communication_3" "This is a nice teammate, let's acknowledge their existence. Press the 'V' key to turn on your microphone, and say hello!"
        "Script_4_Communication_4" "Wait did you actually talk? This is a tutorial, man. That is not a real person."
        "Script_4_Communication_5" "It's OK, let’s not use our microphones then. Press 'Y' to open up the chat wheel, and select 'Well played!'. This is universal for 'thanks' in the Dota world."
        "Script_4_Communication_6" "Also used for “you suck” surprisingly."
        "Script_4_Communication_7" "Oh thanks! You too!"
        "Script_4_Communication_8" "WHAT THE BLEEP ARE YOU DOING? YOU KILLED RIKI YOU'RE STEALING MY KILLS! WHY DO YOU HAVE SO MANY WARDS IN YOUR INVENTORY AND WHY AREN'T MY CAMPS STACKED?!"
        "Script_4_Communication_9" "Oh dear, looks like we have a rager on our hands."
        "Script_4_Communication_10" "Dota is a hard game. For some, they see the challenge and rise up to better themselves and learn that hard work and effort can make you a better person. For some, they become lost, shells of their former selves and drunk on the rage that fuels them."
        "Script_4_Communication_11" "Dota should be a fun place, where you treat others how you want to be treated and work together. There is no surrender button in Dota, because Dota players never give up. But, that doesn't mean that we need to listen to the screeching of this petulant child. Click here to open up the scoreboard."
        "Script_4_Communication_12" "Here's a little video showing you how to mute people in your real games. You shouldn't feel bad. Remember, we're supposed to be having fun!"
        "Script_4_Communication_13" "If you have a rager on your team and you screw up, just hit ‘em with a whoops. No one could possibly be mad at someone spamming whoops, right?"
        "Script_4_Communication_14" "They absolutely can be."
        "Script_4_Communication_15" "Whoops."
        "Script_4_Communication_16" "See? There he goes. His power over us is lost. And we too must go! For there is more to learn!"
        "Script_4_Communication_17" "Head to the next marker. I won't tell you where it is, so use your minimap and camera to find it. We will meet you there!"
        "Script_4_RTZ_getaway" "Later *Bleep*"
        "Script_4_RTZ_foundme" "Shit, they found me."
        "Script_4_RTZ_cya" "See ya!"
        "Script_4_RTZ_death" "Yea I dont know I'm done."
        "Script_4_RTZ_pain" "Ugh."
        "Script_4_mason_mad" "*Breaks items*"
        "Script_5_Opening_1" "Welcome, to the Bounty Rune spawn! Yes there are more things that spawn!"
        "Script_5_Opening_2" "Bounty Runes spawn every five minutes, including the beginning of the game at the 0 mark. Here are where they spawn."
        "Script_5_Opening_3" "Here we are, then here (the radiant jungle). Your opponents also have two spawns, here (the dire jungle) and here (the dire ancients)."
        "Script_5_Opening_4" "Bounty Runes, when picked up, give your entire team a small amount of gold. But it adds up! As the game goes on, the Runes are worth more and more. Making sure you are collecting your side’s Bounty Runes is a way to ensure your team stays in the game."
        "Script_5_Opening_5" "If you manage to steal the enemy’s Runes and get all four, your entire team gets a much bigger advantage over the enemy, as you are all making more money while the enemy gets less."
        "Script_5_Opening_6" "But believe it or not, this is not the only type of Rune, dear student. Let's head over here!"
        "Script_5_Opening_7" "This is called a Power Rune spawn. These are powerups that spawn every two minutes, starting at minute 4. These dramatically change your character to be more powerful for a short time. There are many types of these Runes, and I don't feel like telling you about all of them. But we’ll show you with the help of the Power Rune Rangers... which are not actually a real thing."
        "Script_5_Opening_8" "Double Damage!"
        "Script_5_Opening_9" "Illusions!"
        "Script_5_Opening_10" "Invisibility!"
        "Script_5_Opening_11" "Arcane Rune. Ahh, my cooldowns are lower and my spells cost less mana."
        "Script_5_Opening_12" "HASTE WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!"
        "Script_5_Opening_13" "HELP! I need assistance! I'm very badly hurt!"
        "Script_5_Opening_14" "Oh yes, Regeneration. Nectar of the gods!"
        "Script_5_Opening_15" "We are the Power Rune Rangers! With our powers combined... NOTHING CAN STOP US!"
        "Script_5_Opening_16" "Yes, as we watch our heroes get destroyed by the mighty Roshan, let me sum up our lesson here! Creeps spawn every 30 seconds. Power runes every two minutes, Bounty runes every five minutes and outposts every ten. There is a ton happening on the Dota map, and you as a team need to handle all of this as well as murdering your enemies. We have a saying in Dota: if you are standing still, you are most likely doing something wrong. There is always something to do, so go forth and do it!"
        "Script_5_Roshan_1" "OK, let’s talk about the horrible monster you just saw. His name is Roshan and he lives int he pit. Let's go inside."
        "Script_5_Roshan_2" "Roshan is a big badass that will beat anyone who attacks him to death in his little nerd cave. He's probably pretty angry because he gets no Wi-Fi signal in there. To defeat him, most teams will potentially need a bunch of heroes in the area to attack him and take him down. But, we've been talking to you for so long, we thought that you would like to fight him alone for fun."
        "Script_5_Roshan_3" "Here are some hyper late game items for Dragon Knight as well as a few level ups. Have fun!"
        "Script_5_Roshan_4" "Oh dear that is a lot of levels. So many that now, you have been gifted talents! Remember when we said that each hero comes with innate skills, but items can change the hero dynamically to be something different? Well talents do the same! At levels 10, 15, 20 and 25 you are given a choice for an upgrade, and those choices let you make the hero fit your playstyle. Select some talents you think you would like!"
        "Script_5_Roshan_5" "OK, that's all the talents, the items, and the confidence we can give you. Defeat Roshan!"
        "Script_5_Roshan_6" "Oh, it's your friends, they have come to do battle with you!"
        "Script_5_Roshan_7" "Well done! Before you lies the Aegis of Immortality. Whoever picks it up is blessed with an extra life. This is very useful for doing things like winning team fights and doing that final push! Go ahead and take it."
        "Script_5_Roshan_8" "Wonderful, wonderful. If only there was a way we could test this out. Feel free to leave the pit."
        "Script_5_5v5_1" "Oh dear, the time has finally come. It is time to use all we have taught you. Time for a TEAM FIGHT! LEARNING IS OVER! KILL THEM ALL!"
        "Script_5_5v5_2" "Oh wow... he's dead. Wow I was not expecting that. Are we bad teachers?"
        "Script_5_5v5_3" "No no no, that guy... that guy was a lost cause my brother. I mean did you see him just kinda flailing around? Poor bastard. That's the fifth player this week."
        "Script_5_5v5_4" "Oh well. Maybe try Candy Crush or something! Bye!"
        "Script_5_5v5_5" "VERY FIRST TEAMFIGHT! WE ARE SO PROUD OF YOU!"
        "Script_5_5v5_6" "We have placed a Teleport Scroll in your inventory. This allows you to quickly traverse the map. Any friendly building, including stolen Outposts, can be teleported to by clicking on the scroll then clicking on the building. In fact, you can click on the scroll anywhere on the minimap, and the game will automatically teleport you as close as possible."
        "Script_5_5v5_7" "But when you're in a jam, clicking on the teleport scroll twice very quickly will teleport you to the safest place on the map, your friendly fountain. Keep in mind that when you DO teleport, you will be required to channel it. Channeling essentially means that you can’t move or do anything while it's happening. And if you do, your TP will be canceled and completely wasted."
        "Script_5_5v5_8" "Click on the Teleport Scroll twice now. We have a surprise for you. Also, have a Teleport Scroll on you if you don't you're a noob."
        "Script_5_5v5_9" "OK actually no, really, we want you to promise us you will always have a Teleport Scroll on you. For real. If we ever see you without a TP scroll on your person, you are going to make us look bad."
        "Script_5_5v5_10" "Every time you see that circle without a TP in it, picture your big, lonely heart there insead, looking for it’s soul mate. Give the circle it’s soul mate. Buy two or three at a time if you must."
        "Script_5_5v5_11" "Promise us you will always have one. Press 'V', the microphone button, and say you promise that you will."
        "Script_5_5v5_12" "Bro we told you we are not real, we can't hear you hahaha. OK, let's go!"
        "Script_5_5v5_13" "Not falling for that again ey? Fine. We believe in you. Don't let us down. LET'S GO!"
        "Script_6_Opening_1" "And here we are, we've truly come full circle."
        "Script_6_Opening_2" "You did a great job in the tutorial. We are very proud to have you join us."
        "Script_6_Opening_3" "Now, some final lessons. First, let's talk about heroes that aren’t Dragon Knight."
        "Script_6_Opening_4" "Heroes are broken down into 3 categories. Strength, Agility, and Intelligence. Your hero, Dragon Knight, is a Strength hero. They are known for being beefy. Having a ton of health, and staying in fights a long time as they beat their enemies down with brute force."
        "Script_6_Opening_5" "Agility heroes are glass cannons, for a while! These heroes are known for dealing lots of damage later in the game, but are relatively weak at the start. They need to weave in and out of combat to be effective, doing large amounts of damage but then escaping before the enemy can kill them."
        "Script_6_Opening_6" "Intelligence heros are kind of the opposite. They are typically strongest in the early game, but become weaker as the game goes on. However, they are able to cast powerful spells which allow for games to never get to the late game at all!"
        "Script_6_Opening_7" "These are further broken down into roles, such as position 1, the carry, position 2, the mid, position 3, the offlane, and pos 4 and 5, the supports. But we won't get into that garbage."
        "Script_6_Opening_8" "The time has come for you to decide, which hero class best suits you? Are you the kind of guy who wades into the battle with his big belly ready to smash? Or are you the cunning assassin? Perhaps you would rather destroy your enemies in an instant with a powerful spell? That is for you to decide."
        "Script_6_Opening_9" "And that is it my friend, the end of the tutorial. Oh wait, one thing.."
        "Script_6_Closing_1" "These are all of the people who made this possible, as well as some community members that have more advanced resources for you. Dota is a nearly impossible game to master, but that’s what makes it so fun! Go up to any of the people at the party and click on them, and they will introduce themselves and link you to additional resources and advanced guides."
        "Script_6_Closing_2" "We will miss you young one. Make sure to say goodbye before you leave. You are now ready."
        "Script_6_Closing_3" "Don't feel bad if you lose, you're going to lose a lot."
        "Script_6_Closing_4" "That’s true, but Dota is one of the most rewarding games to play if you give it a chance. The map is yours my child. Good luck, and have fun!"
        "Script_6_Closing_5" "Whenever you're ready to to say good bye yourself, feel free to destroy the enemy Ancient. Keep in mind that in order to do that you must first destroy the Tier 4 towers protecting it."
        "Script_6_Closing_6" "To make it easier for you to plow through the Dire's defenses, we've put a Divine Rapier in your inventory. Now go and destroy them all!"
        "Script_6_anger" "What’s popping gamer?! My name is AngerMania and I make lore videos on Youtube. If you feel overwhelmed with all this new knowledge and you’re worried that you’re not gonna ever get good at this game, you could always take a break from the gameplay and learn about the lore!

        "Script_6_Tsunami" "What's up? I'm Tsunami. If you start following Dota 2 esports you'll probably hear more of me. But once upon a time, I also had no idea what was going on in this crazy game. So I decided to document every time I saw a weird interaction or some spell mechanic that you'd only know after hours of playing a hero. I ended up compiling all of those tips on my site, howdoiplay.com. Take a look if you want some quick advice on how to play or counter specific heroes."

        "MessageToTheNoobs_1" "Sending out an item on the courier? Consider sending out a salve or clarity too; 50 to 110 gold now is well worth higher efficiency later"
        "MessageToTheNoobs_2" "Dota pro tip: Play with friends. If you don't have any yet, keep playing, and you'll make some!"
        "MessageToTheNoobs_3" "When you finally wrap your head around Dota, I promise you, no other game will feel as rewarding as it!"
        "MessageToTheNoobs_4" "If you find something harmless in this game genuinely funny (especially if it's at your own expense), hold down that the mic button. Often everyone else saw the same thing and all it takes is one broadcast laugh, suddenly five strangers are all laughing on mic."

        "MessageToTheNoobs_12" "Think a hero is broken? They playing them yourself! You will learn their power spikes and when they are weak. Next time you face them, capitalize on their weakness and beware of the power spikes."
        "MessageToTheNoobs_13" "Remember that on average you're only going to win 50% of your games. Learn to lose, and learn from your losses. Most importantly, learn to find enjoyment in your losses. That's half of Dota after all :)"
        "MessageToTheNoobs_14" "Wards create space, space creates gold, gold creates push, push creates victory"
        "MessageToTheNoobs_15" "Remember that the mute button is for the weak."

        "MessageToTheNoobs_17" "Dota is a great game, the best game even, but sometimes, there are people who wanna spoil your fun. Whether it’s angry teammates shouting at you, or veteran players who have snuck their way into your game and is slaughtering everyone. It sucks, but don’t let it discourage you! Mute the grumps and shrug at the bullies – if you keep at it, Dota will be the best game you ever played, guaranteed."
        "MessageToTheNoobs_18" "Games are so much easier if you mute toxic players instead of engaging."

        "MessageToTheNoobs_24" "Try your best to commit to playing only a few heroes initially, since it is best to have great knowledge with few, rather than little knowledge with many."

        "MessageToTheNoobs_26" "Remember that you can't control what others do in game, but you can focus on what you should do."
        "MessageToTheNoobs_27" "This game, like any other online game, has it's frustrating moments. But past all of that, it's a fun and challenging game. Especially with friends. Keep at it. Everyone starts somewhere, and win or lose, it's just another opportunity to learn and get better."
        "MessageToTheNoobs_28" "Dota 2 is meant for fun, despite what you might hear. Mute the people who are toxic, and learn about the game at your own pace. Enjoying yourself is the most important thing, even if you want to take it seriously!"
        "MessageToTheNoobs_29" "past min 7, save TP for reactions, walk to lane instead"
        "MessageToTheNoobs_30" "Pressing your buttons well doesn't require thinking, it just requires that you play the game. Thinking about the game, looking at the clock and the minimap however, requires you to consciously do it until it becomes a habit"
        "MessageToTheNoobs_31" "Remember ABT: Always Ban Techies"
        "MessageToTheNoobs_32" "Remember, support is a good class to start with as you can learn to help your teammates easier."

        "MessageToTheNoobs_39" "love yourself"
        "MessageToTheNoobs_40" "Heroes in Dota tend to provide control or damage. For best results find an ally with the component your hero lacks and go nuts!"
        "MessageToTheNoobs_41" "Dota's like an instrument. You'll improve with time, and improving's fun. Don't beat yourself (or others!) up for not being amazing right away. I believe in you :)"
        "MessageToTheNoobs_42" "A good support can carry the game."
        "MessageToTheNoobs_43" "The only player in all of your losses was you. Focus on improving from your mistakes rather than what your teammates did wrong."

        "MessageToTheNoobs_48" "Dota 2 is the most rewarding, frustrating, entertaining, exhilarating, maddening, complex, and complicated game ever made. It never gets old, always changing with new and exciting variables with every new match. Every teammate will have strengths and weaknesses, every draft will change and morph to better or worsen your chances of victory. Every item selection or ability build will change your odds, but ultimately your understanding of timing and mechanics will gain you an exhilarating victory. Good Luck, Have Fun."
        "MessageToTheNoobs_49" "Never forget, no matter what mistakes you make don't dwell on them, learn from them and do better next time; that's all anyone can ask of you."
