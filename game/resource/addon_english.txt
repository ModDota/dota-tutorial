        "Script_1_Opening_1" "Oh look at this! New blood! The dragon knight himself!"
        "Script_1_Opening_2" "Fresh from the Netflix anime are you? Welcome to the world of dota 2! We are here to teach you how to navigate the best game ever made."
        "Script_1_Opening_3" "except for artifact"
        "Script_1_Opening_4" "Yes, yes, of course, except for artifact"
        "Script_1_Opening_5" "first things first, lets take you through the main goals of the game, defense of the ancients."
        "Script_1_Opening_6" "is it to defend the ancients by any chance?"
        "Script_1_Opening_7" "no, surprisingly, it is to kill the enemy Ancient. See, this is why you need us."
        "Script_1_Opening_8" "this is the dota 2 map, your personal battlefield. You are currently in your fountain. It will heal you and is where you can purchase items, which are power ups for your hero."
        "Script_1_Opening_9" "this is also where you will respawn after you die, which i'm sure is coming up very soon"
        "Script_1_Opening_10" "this, all the way over here, is the enemy ancient, this is what you are trying to destroy."
        "Script_1_Opening_11" "but we have a long way to go before that."
        "Script_1_Movement_1" "so, let's start off with baby steps. Let's get you to move. Move the cursor with your mouse and hover over this very generic tutorial type way-point."
        "Script_1_Movement_2" "That’s mean, I think it looks pretty."
        "Script_1_Movement_3" "You would. Something as ugly as you would think that……..BROTHER"
        "Script_1_Movement_4" "oh my goodness it’s first steps! SOMEONE GRAB THE CAMERA!"
        "Script_1_Movement_5" "OK, now move on to the next step. Oh hey, it’s Mirana, from the anime."
        "Script_1_Movement_6" "Actually she’s is a very old hero, in fact, she was in the original Dota."
        "Script_1_Movement_7" "Mirana from the anime!"
        "Script_1_Movement_8" "Anyway, she’s very protective of us for some reason. Watch out for her arrows. Simply dodge them when she fires at you."
        "Script_1_Movement_9" "Generic Greeting"
        "Script_1_Movement_10" "Nice Dodging"
        "Script_1_Movement_11" "that's a good effort! Very good you are a real walking pro. Now, let's get to the hard stuff. I am going to unlock your camera now. If at any point you get lost, the F1 key will bring you back to your hero."
        "Script_1_Camera_1" "woah woah where are you goin?! This guys out of his mind! Reel it back in kiddo"
        "Script_1_Camera_2" "in the game of dota, you will need to move your camera while simultaneously moving your hero to a selected spot. This is difficult to master but is step one. We will help you, but first we need to get you ready to fight if you want to survive outside of the safety of your fountain."
        "Script_1_Camera_3" "here is a target dummy"
        "Script_1_Camera_4" "Spawn Line"
        "Script_1_Camera_5" "this is the new player that showed up yesterday! He didn't make it past the movement part. Hover your mouse over the dummy and right click him to attack!"
        "Script_1_Camera_6" "Dying Line"
        "Script_1_Camera_7" "oh my that was very violent. Wait, why do I have a health bar over my head now?"
        "Script_1_Camera_8" "come on you know you want too. Do it. Attack the man"
        "Script_1_Camera_9" "AUGGGGHH WHYYY WHY GOD IT HURTS"
        "Script_1_Camera_10" "JESUS WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!"
        "Script_1_Leveling_1" "oh look at that you leveled up and got a ton of gold! Killing enemies, or just being in the general area of killed enemies or….. i guess helpful tutorial golems allows you to gain experience and gold. Gaining experience allows you to level up, like in an RPG game. As you can see, you were already provided your third skill, Dragon Blood, which is a passive, meaning it just works. Now, you can select another skill! Let’s have you select an active ability. Click on the plus sign over Dragon Tail."
        "Script_1_Leveling_2" "Feel free to hover over your skills at any time, to learn more about them. Probably best not to do this during the game though as other people might laugh at you. You can also read up on all the hero skills in the heroes tab, which is in the main menu of Dota."
        "Script_1_Leveling_3" "oh no, here comes pugna. He's so annoying"
        "Script_1_Leveling_4" "yellow everybody this is pugna and i'm here to talk to you today about the difference between strength, agility, and intelligence"
        "Script_1_Leveling_5" "oh god make him stop! Use your ability! Press the w key or hover over the icon and select the skill you want to use."
        "Script_1_Leveling_6" "good! Now hover the mouse over the enemy unit and left click it! Your hero will automatically walk toward the enemy until the spell is in range!"
        "Script_1_Leveling_7" "Please don’t interrupt me. Now let me begin again."
        "Script_1_Leveling_8" "oh no ahhh"
        "Script_1_Leveling_9" "excellent work! I'm a ghost now by the way! Looks like you got enough exp for another level! Try putting it in your breathe fire ability!"
        "Script_1_Leveling_10" "your dragon tail is a single target ability, meaning you can target an enemy and it will cast it on them, as long as you are in range Breathe Fire on the other hand, is a target point ability, meaning you can target a point, like a place on the map, but not specific unit."
        "Script_1_BreatheFire_1" "why do I have a health bar?"
        "Script_1_BreatheFire_2" "It’s your turn dear brother. you know what to do young one. Press q, aka your breathe fire ability, or simply select it with your mouse, then click on the ground with the left mouse button in the direction you want to cast."
        "Script_1_BreatheFire_3" "no NO NO"
        "Script_1_BreatheFire_4" "AHHHH IT BURNS...well i guess we are both ghosts now."
        "Script_1_BreatheFire_5" "yes both ghosts, here to haunt you for eternity. Just keep in mind that this is NOT in a normal dota game. You will not be haunted by ghosts I promise. You know what else will haunt you? Hit the shop button!"
        "Script_1_Shop_1" "oh my god there are so many items! MY EYES!"
        "Script_1_Shop_2" "Items are one of the many reasons this game is so deep. A hero by default, will be good at a specific thing depending on who you pick. But items allow you to change them to excel in areas they may not be able to normally."
        "Script_1_Shop_3" "Certain items can allow you to open up completely different play-styles for your heroes. Think of Dota heroes as rock, paper, scissors. Rock will always beat scissors, but in Dota, scissors can specifically build itself to be a little better against rock, should the need arise."
        "Script_1_Shop_4" "I know there are way too many items to remember, but worry not little one, the community has made guides for every single hero, telling you what usually works well on the hero you are playing. Here is how to open them. Select this button here."
        "Script_1_Shop_5" "i made this guide for you, its called “items a first time dragon knight needs at this very second”"
        "Script_1_Shop_6" "oh very specific. Confirm that guide youngling!"
        "Script_1_Shop_7" "there you have it. Now you can just right-click on the item in your guide, and if you have the money for it the item will be bought automatically. Your gold is down in the bottom right. Congrats. I think you have enough money from murdering 3 people in the short time you arrived here, so go on ahead."
        "Script_1_Closing_1" "ok creature of mine, it's time for you to escape this hellish prison we have designed for you. Click on the item in your inventory, just like you would a spell, and then click select one of the trees. Are you starting to see a pattern?"
        "Script_1_Closing_2" "i hope so"
        "Script_1_Closing_3" "you did it! Don’t ask why eating a tree is a good thing in this game, it just is. You can now escape! Go little one run before we change our minds!"
        "Script_1_Closing_4" "we are giving you back control over your camera. It's time to walk and look baby. Goodluck!"
        "Script_1_Closing_5" "did you really think we would just let you out? NO! WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF TREES!"
        "Script_1_Closing_6" "go baby infant! Follow this very not ominous path! Practice your moving and camera control! Keep in mind that you can move your camera in two ways. Number one is for cool people: where you middle click your mouse on the ground and hold it while dragging. Or you can be like my idiot mud golem brother, and move your cursor to the edge of the screen. All of this of course you can change in your game settings."

        "Script_2_Opening_1" "And here we are. Welcome to the top radiant barracks. Before you lay several buildings each with their own purpose and destiny."
        "Script_2_Opening_2" "Except for that one there. That's a moon well."
        "Script_2_Opening_3" "Yes, that is just there to look cool. Do you think it's cool? I do."
        "Script_2_Opening_4" "Very good. So, to your right you can see the melee barracks, and to the left you see the ranged barracks. These two buildings spawn creeps."
        "Script_2_Opening_5" "Don't worry, not creeps like people that have bodypillows. Creeps like... uh... what are creeps like?"
        "Script_2_Opening_6" "The creeps spawn every 30 seconds and walk down the path ahead of them, called a lane. The creeps are uncontrollable and have one mission, to mindlessly walk down the path and attack any enemy they come in contact with. This includes enemy heroes, buildings, or emotions!"
        "Script_2_Opening_7" "That's right. The creeps act as your cannon fodder, making sure that the enemy can't just go to your side of the map and hurt you, or they will be stabbed by a thousand little swords."
        "Script_2_Opening_8" "These barracks are what spawn these creeps, so as you can imagine if you destroy the enemy's barracks, then they will become weakened. There is one set of barracks in each of the three lanes. These lanes are referred to as top, middle and bottom."
        "Script_2_Opening_9" "Now, if you destroy the barracks, the enemy creeps don't just stop spawning. They continue to spawn, but your creeps get stronger in each lane that lacks an enemy barracks. And if you take them all, you are awarded MEGA CREEPS which are very powerful and can gang up to kill even heroes!"
        "Script_2_Opening_10" "Indeed! Think of Dota like this: killing other players allows you to have time to hit their buildings while they respawn. Hitting buildings is the true goal of Dota, for when there are no buildings the enemy Ancient is exposed. The game in a nutshell is essentially an elaborate tug of war where both sides try to outpush the other."
        "Script_2_Opening_11" "Yes. Well that technically would be the opposite of a tug of war."
        "Script_2_Opening_12" "Quiet, you!"
        "Script_2_Opening_13" "Dota is a game about creeps, and exposing things. This is actually not a joke!"
        "Script_2_Creeps_1"   "So the creeps have now connected and are fighting each other. As you can see, whenever an enemy unit dies, you will gain experience as long as you are in the general area. Whether you kill the unit or not, you will still get experience."
        "Script_2_Creeps_2"   "But in order to get gold, YOU must be the one to get the killing blow. We call this a last hit. This concept works for anything killable in Dota, including buildings."
        "Script_2_Creeps_3"   "OK, try getting the last hit on some of these creeps, with the help of our long lost Australian brother who specializes in last hit training."
        "Script_2_Creeps_4"   "Australian thing"
        "Script_2_Creeps_5"   "Depending on your hero, you can also use spells to kill creeps. Just keep in mind that this will cost you a very precious commodity. Remember, auto attacking costs you nothing, but spells typically use a resource called mana, which is your blue bar. Go ahead and kill some with Breathe Fire."
        "Script_2_Creeps_6"   "GOOD BYE MATE"
        "Script_2_Creeps_7"   "And look who we have here, an enemy hero!"
        "Script_2_Creeps_8"   "This is Sniper, you will probably see a lot of him in your games. Everyone really hates him."
        "Script_2_Creeps_9"   "Your hero Dragon Knight is a melee hero, which typically means you will be a bit tankier than ranged heroes like Sniper. But of course the downside to being melee, is you have to get closer in order to attack."
        "Script_2_Creeps_10"    "As you can see, Sniper is actually getting the last hit on some of his own creeps. Why would someone ever do such a thing?"
        "Script_2_Creeps_11"    "This is called denying. When an allied creep is at low health, you can actually attack it by hitting the 'A' key and selecting your creep. If you get the last hit then the enemy will actually get less experience. This is what separates us from the plebians over at League."
        "Script_2_Creeps_12"    "Try denying some of your creeps now."
        "Script_2_Creeps_13"    "Great, you've denied some creeps, which means Sniper is less powerful than you right now. Take advantage of this by destroying him."
        "Script_2_Creeps_14"    "Yes, do the community a favor and kill that mother fucker."
        "Script_2_Tower_1"      "Now that that filth sniper has died, push his tower."
        "Script_2_Tower_2"      "Towers are an important objective. Each lane has a few of them for protection. Once you’ve killed one, it’s gone forever. Go ahead and try to destroy that tower. Doing so is the same versus any other unit in the game. You can simply right click it to attack."
        "Script_2_Tower_3"      "Now you know the pain of death. Let this be an important lesson for you. Pushing towers can be very dangerous."
        "Script_2_Tower_4"      "As you can see, you are now dead. But luckily for you, death is not permanent, unlike for us mod golems. Your respawn timer can be seen at the top hud or your personal hero portrait. You will always respawn in the fountain."
        "Script_2_Tower_5"      "Your respawn time is based on how much experience you have. THe longer the game goes, the longer your respawn time will be. Luckily for us, you are a noob, so you’ll be back very quickly."
        "Script_2_Tower_6"      "Even though you’re dead, you can still be valuable to your team by overseeing the map in order to make the best decisions in the game. Example being where should you go next? Or what item does an enemy have? What is the meaning of life? All these things can be learned while you’re dead."
        "Script_2_Tower_7"      "Time to go back to the tower. Typically you’d need an item to teleport there, but I’m bored, so let us help you out a bit!"
        "Script_2_Tower_8"      "This time, let’s be more cautious. Every tower has a radius in which they will start attacking enemy units. Hold the Alt button, to see how big it is."
        "Script_2_Tower_9"     "As you can see, when the creeps enter the area of the tower, it started attacking the first target it sees. This can allow you to move within the tower’s range without getting hit. Ok, try getting to the other side of the tower without taking damage."
        "Script_2_Tower_10"     "Ok, now get back to your side."
        "Script_2_Tower_11"     "Start killing the tower. Just remember that towers typically only attack 1 unit at a time, so just use your creeps to tank it up for you."
        "Script_2_Tower_12"     "Ok, you are actually pretty weak, so lets level you up to 6, which will provide you with your ultimate ability. In addition, we’ll gladly provide you some late game items."
        "Script_2_Tower_13"     "Damn you are strong now! Activate your ultimate, which turns you into a DRAGON!"
        "Script_2_Tower_14"     "Doing so will actually turn you into a ranged hero, pretty cool huh?"
        "Script_2_Tower_15"     "Now kill that tower!"
        "Script_2_Tower_16"     "The enemy just activated his glyph. It will temporarily make all his towers and creeps invulnerable for a short amount of time. Go ahead and try clicking it yourself!"
        "Script_2_Tower_17"     "Nicely done. Now destroy the tower once and for all!"
        "Script_2_Tower_18"     "You’ll notice we have deleted your items. Don’t actually do this in a match or you might get reported!"

        "Script_4_Opening_1" "ok, we just saw an enemy in the jungle. It is time to hunt them! But first, let’s talk about vision."
        "Script_4_Opening_2" "To have the best chance of killing someone, my friend, you must see them first. The fog of war covers all areas of the map where you lack vision."
        "Script_4_Opening_3" "as you can see here, you may be able to see the terrain, but if there are any enemies here you will not be able to see them without vision."
        "Script_4_Opening_4" "Look at these creeps. See how when they walk, the fog of war is lifted? Any friendly units, such as your creeps, your buildings, your allies, and of course YOU will pierce the fog of war."
        "Script_4_Opening_5" "but like everything in dota, it’s not that simple. You can only have vision in your line of sight. So if you are standing on the low ground of a hill, like we are now, you will not be able to see the high ground."
        "Script_4_Opening_6" "DON'T TRY IT"
        "Script_4_Opening_7" "the same goes for all these trees. If you can put an object in-between an enemy and yourself, then they will lose vision of you, and you can potentially escape them!"
        "Script_4_Opening_8" "we call that there a JUKE!"
        "Script_4_Opening_9" "ok with all that out of the way, now we know that riki could be right at the top of this hill, and he could see us. Let's make sure with a scan!"
        "Script_4_Opening_10" "behold the scan icon."
        "Script_4_Opening_11" "you can use a scan to click anywhere on your minimap and check to see if enemies are in that area, without vision! Try scanning here!"
        "Script_4_Opening_12" "click on scan with your left mouse button, then click on the target."
        "Script_4_Opening_13" "ah, no enemies there. When an enemy is under the scan, it will turn red and make an alarm sound!"
        "Script_4_Opening_14" "Usually the scan will go on cooldown for a while, but we will keep it available just for you.Scan agan, but at the highground where we are! This will also be a test to see if you can find yourself on the minimap!"
        "Script_4_Opening_15" "that is a scan, but we want you to scan around where we are. See that arrow on your mini map? Thats you! Scan right in front of you, where the arrow is pointing. That's the direction you are facing!"
        "Script_4_Opening_16" "oh my goodness, the enemy is right up that hill! What should we do?"
        "Script_4_Opening_17" "charge up blindly with no plan?"
        "Script_4_Opening_18" "thats what most idiots would do, but not us! We are going to use VISION! BEHOLD THE WARD"
        "Script_4_Wards_1" "go pick those up and come back here."
        "Script_4_Wards_2" "wards are typically bought in the shop like a regular item. They give you vision in an area, even when no friendly units are there. They can be put on the high ground to give the best vision in the game! Wards are very important, as they can reveal what is lurking in the dark areas of the map."
        "Script_4_Wards_3" "Perhaps revealing enemies, so you can kill them"
        "Script_4_Wards_4" "and you can use wards defensively in your own jungle, so you can see when the enemy is coming!"
        "Script_4_Wards_5" "so they cant kill you!"
        "Script_4_Wards_6" "now i know what you're thinking, the map is huge! Where should i put my wards? Well, good news friend, the best ones are already marked."
        "Script_4_Wards_7" "These cliffs marked with the eye symbol are some of the best places to put wards in the game. They provide good vision, are in vital choke points on the map, and can be used offensively and defensively"
        "Script_4_Wards_8" "ok, let's put a ward on this high ground before we just walk up there to our deaths. Select the ward in your inventory with the left mouse button, then click on the high ground target. This will place the ward. You don't need to be very close to do it!"
        "Script_4_Wards_9" "well done! But whats this? There is no one here! This cant be right, we scanned this area and it said someone was here? Are the scans lying? Is nothing real?"
        "Script_4_Wards_10" "Calm down friend. Now go pick up that odd blue ward."
        "Script_4_Wards_11" "Notice that it combines with your other ward in your inventory. Please double click on your ward in your inventory"
        "Script_4_Wards_12" "this blue ward is called a sentry ward. It’s job is to show invisible things. This includes wards, and other units that are invisible! Place your blue sentry ward down on top of your yellow observer ward, just like you did last time. Click on the ward with the left mouse button, and then click on the map to place it in on the target."
        "Script_4_Wards_13" "HOLY SHIT"
        "Script_4_Wards_14" "AH HA! There he is! Go and attack him! Click on him with your right mouse button!"
        "Script_4_Wards_15" "oh nooo, he left the area of your sentry! Hold alt to see the area of effect your sentry has."
        "Script_4_Outpost_1" "Looks like we will need to hunt him down. Here is a dust of appearance!"
        "Script_4_Outpost_2" "Pick that up, and walk in the direction you saw the riki"
        "Script_4_Outpost_3" "Now hit the dust and hope he is close!"
        "Script_4_Outpost_4" "There he is! Get that pile of garbage"
        "Script_4_Outpost_5" "Oh no, we lost him again. Maybe this time for good. Oh, one last idea. Let's take that enemy outpost!"
        "Script_4_Outpost_6" "This structure is the enemy outpost. The outpost, when under your control, gives you vision, both regular and truesight vision, which is what we use to see those invisible units. You can take the enemy outpost only after you take a tier 2 tower, which is the second tower in any lane"
        "Script_4_Outpost_7" "It didn't used to be like that but trust me it was annoying"
        "Script_4_Outpost_8" "Yes indeed. Anyway, right click on the enemy outpost to take it."
        "Script_4_Outpost_9" "QUICK! THERE HE IS! KILL HIM!"
        "Script_4_Outpost_10" "THats one more invis spamming bastard down!"
        "Script_4_Outpost_11" "Great work. The outpost also gives you a place to teleport to, and will give your entire team experience every 10 minutes! Try to make sure you control both outposts, yours and your enemies, before each 10 minute interval on the clock!"
        "Script_4_Communication_1" "oh my goodness! You killed riki! Thank you so much, great job!"
        "Script_4_Communication_2" "oh dear, this is one of your teammates! Don't worry they cant hear us, we are ghosts that only haunt you!"
        "Script_4_Communication_3" "this is a nice teammate, lets acknowledge their existence. Press the v key to turn on your microphone, and say hello!"
        "Script_4_Communication_4" "wait did you actually talk? This is a tutorial man that is not a real person."
        "Script_4_Communication_5" "It's ok, let’s not use our microphones then. Press ‘ to open up the chat wheel, and select “well played!” this is universal for “thanks” in the dota world"
        "Script_4_Communication_6" "also used for “you suck” surprisingly."
        "Script_4_Communication_7" "oh thanks! You too!"
        "Script_4_Communication_8" "WHAT THE BLEEP ARE YOU DOING? YOU KILLED RIKI YOUR STEALING MY KILLS! WHY DO YOU HAVE SO MANY WARDS IN YOUR INVENTORY AND WHY ARNT MY CAMPS STACKED?!"
        "Script_4_Communication_9" "oh dear, looks like we have a rager on our hands."
        "Script_4_Communication_10" "dota is a hard game. For some, they see the challenge and rise up to better themselves and learn that hard work and effort can make you a better person. For some, they become lost, shells of their former selves and drunk on the rage that fuels them"
        "Script_4_Communication_11" "dota should be a fun place, where you treat others how you want to be treated and work together. There is no surrender button in dota, because dota players never give up. But, that doesn't mean that we need to listen to the screeching of this petulant child. Click here to open up the scoreboard."
        "Script_4_Communication_12" "Now, see the hero that is being an annoying piece of shit and press the microphone button to mute them. You can mute their voice, and if you feel really frisky, you can mute their text too!"
        "Script_4_Communication_13" "feel free to hit them with a well played as well."
        "Script_4_Communication_14" "don't do that, that is also toxic"
        "Script_4_Communication_15" "eh"
        "Script_4_Communication_16" "see? There he goes. his power over us is lost. And we too must go! For there is more to learn!"
        "Script_4_Communication_17" "Head to the next marker. I won't tell you where it is, so use your minimap and camera to find it. We will meet you there!"

        "Script_5_Opening_1" "welcome, to the bounty rune spawn! Yes there are more things that spawn!"
        "Script_5_Opening_2" "bounty runes spawn every 5 minutes, including the beginning of the game at the 0 mark. Here are where they spawn"
        "Script_5_Opening_3" "Here we are, then here (the radiant jungle). Your opponents also have 2 spawns, here (the dire jungle) and here (the dire ancients)."
        "Script_5_Opening_4" "Bounty runes, when picked up, give your entire team a small amount of gold. But it adds up! As the game goes on, the runes are worth more and more. Making sure you are collecting your side’s bounty runes is a great way to make sure your team stays in the game."
        "Script_5_Opening_5" "If you manage to steal the enemy’s runes, and get all 4, your entire team gets a much bigger advantage over the enemy, as you are all making more money while the enemy gets less."
        "Script_5_Opening_6" "But believe it or not, this is not the only type of rune, dear student. Lets head over here!"
        "Script_5_Opening_7" "This is called a POWER RUNE spawn. These are powerups that spawn every 2 minutes, starting at minute 4. These dramatically change your character to be more powerful for a short time. There are many types of these runes, and I don't feel like telling you about all of them. Just take them if they pop upso the enemy doesn't get them"
        "Script_5_Opening_8" "Yes! Are you starting to see a pattern here? Creeps spawn every 30 seconds. Power runes every 2 minutes, Bounty runes every 5 minutes and Outposts every ten. There is a ton happening on the dota 2 map, and you as a team need to handle all of this as well as murdering your enemies. We have a saying in dota: if you are standing still, you are most likely doing something wrong. There is always something to do, so go forth and do it!"
        "Script_5_Opening_9" "Now, lets give you my favorite rune, the double damage rune, and introduce you to someone very special."
        "Script_5_Opening_10" "Click on it to pick it up, young one!"
