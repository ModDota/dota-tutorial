        "Script_1_Opening_1" "Oh look at this! New blood! The dragon knight himself!"
        "Script_1_Opening_2" "Fresh from the Netflix anime are you? Welcome to the world of dota 2! We are here to teach you how to navigate the best game ever made."
        "Script_1_Opening_3" "except for artifact"
        "Script_1_Opening_4" "Yes, yes, of course, except for artifact"
        "Script_1_Opening_5" "first things first, lets take you through the main goals of the game, defense of the ancients."
        "Script_1_Opening_6" "is it to defend the ancients by any chance?"
        "Script_1_Opening_7" "no, surprisingly, it is to kill the enemy Ancient. See, this is why you need us."
        "Script_1_Opening_8" "this is the dota 2 map, your personal battlefield. You are currently in your fountain. It will heal you and is where you can purchase items, which are power ups for your hero."
        "Script_1_Opening_9" "this is also where you will respawn after you die, which i'm sure is coming up very soon"
        "Script_1_Opening_10" "this, all the way over here, is the enemy ancient, this is what you are trying to destroy."
        "Script_1_Opening_11" "but we have a long way to go before that."
        "Script_1_Movement_1" "so, let's start off with baby steps. Let's get you to move. Move the cursor with your mouse and hover over this very generic tutorial type way-point."
        "Script_1_Movement_2" "That’s mean, I think it looks pretty."
        "Script_1_Movement_3" "You would. Something as ugly as you would think that……..BROTHER"
        "Script_1_Movement_4" "oh my goodness it’s first steps! SOMEONE GRAB THE CAMERA!"
        "Script_1_Movement_5" "OK, now move on to the next step."
        "Script_1_Movement_6" "Oh hey, it’s our australian brother. He’s very protective of us so he might throw giant rocks at you. You must dodge the rocks he throws by simply moving out of the way. Good luck."
        "Script_1_Movement_7" "nan"
        "Script_1_Movement_8" "hahaha, and that's how you respawn. Don’t be discouraged. Go defeat our brother!"
        "Script_1_Movement_9" "Crikey mate. Good luck in your endeavors."
        "Script_1_Movement_10" "that's a good effort! Very good you are a real walking pro. Now, let's get to the hard stuff. I am going to unlock your camera now"
        "Script_1_Camera_1" "woah woah where are you goin?! This guys out of his mind! Reel it back in kiddo"
        "Script_1_Camera_2" "in the game of dota, you will need to move your camera while simultaneously moving your hero to a selected spot. This is difficult to master but is step one. We will help you, but first we need to get you ready to fight if you want to survive outside of the safety of your fountain."
        "Script_1_Camera_3" "here is a target dummy"
        "Script_1_Camera_4" "Spawn Line"
        "Script_1_Camera_5" "this is the new player that showed up yesterday! He didn't make it past the movement part. Hover your mouse over the dummy and right click him to attack!"
        "Script_1_Camera_6" "Dying Line"
        "Script_1_Camera_7" "oh my that was very violent. Wait, why do I have a health bar over my head now?"
        "Script_1_Camera_8" "come on you know you want too. Do it. Attack the man"
        "Script_1_Camera_9" "AUGGGGHH WHYYY WHY GOD IT HURTS"
        "Script_1_Camera_10" "JESUS WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!"
        "Script_1_Leveling_1" "oh look at that you leveled up and got a ton of gold! Killing enemies, or just being in the general area of killed enemies or….. i guess helpful tutorial golems allows you to gain experience and gold. Gaining experience allows you to level up, like in an RPG game. As you can see, you were already provided your third skill, Dragon Blood, which is a passive, meaning it just works. Now, you can select another skill! Let’s have you select an active ability. Click on the plus sign over Dragon Tail."
        "Script_1_Leveling_2" "Feel free to hover over your skills at any time, to learn more about them. Probably best not to do this during the game though as other people might laugh at you. You can also read up on all the hero skills in the heroes tab, which is in the main menu of Dota."
        "Script_1_Leveling_3" "oh no, here comes pugna. He's so annoying"
        "Script_1_Leveling_4" "yellow everybody this is pugna and i'm here to talk to you today about the difference between strength, agility, and intelligence"
        "Script_1_Leveling_5" "oh god make him stop! Use your ability! Press the w key or hover over the icon and select the skill you want to use."
        "Script_1_Leveling_6" "good! Now hover the mouse over the enemy unit and right click it! Your hero will automatically walk toward the enemy until the spell is in range!"
        "Script_1_Leveling_7" "Please don’t interrupt me. Now let me begin again."
        "Script_1_Leveling_8" "oh no ahhh"
        "Script_1_Leveling_9" "excellent work! I'm a ghost now by the way! Looks like you got enough exp for another level! Try putting it in your breathe fire ability!"
        "Script_1_Leveling_10" "your dragon tail is a single target ability, meaning you can target an enemy and it will cast it on them, as long as you are in range Breathe Fire on the other hand, is a target point ability, meaning you can target a point, like a place on the map, but not specific unit."
        "Script_1_BreatheFire_1" "why do I have a health bar?"
        "Script_1_BreatheFire_2" "It’s your turn dear brother. you know what to do young one. Press q, aka your breathe fire ability, or simply select it with your mouse, then click on the ground with the left mouse button in the direction you want to cast."
        "Script_1_BreatheFire_3" "no NO NO"
        "Script_1_BreatheFire_4" "AHHHH IT BURNS...well i guess we are both ghosts now."
        "Script_1_BreatheFire_5" "yes both ghosts, here to haunt you for eternity. Just keep in mind that this is NOT in a normal dota game. You will not be haunted by ghosts I promise. You know what else will haunt you? Hit the shop button!"
        "Script_1_Shop_1" "oh my god there are so many items! MY EYES!"
        "Script_1_Shop_2" "Items are one of the many reasons this game is so deep. A hero by default, will be good at a specific thing depending on who you pick. But items allow you to change them to excel in areas they may not be able to normally."
        "Script_1_Shop_3" "Certain items can allow you to open up completely different play-styles for your heroes. Think of Dota heroes as rock, paper, scissors. Rock will always beat scissors, but in Dota, scissors can specifically build itself to be a little better against rock, should the need arise."
        "Script_1_Shop_4" "I know there are way too many items to remember, but worry not little one, the community has made guides for every single hero, telling you what usually works well on the hero you are playing. Here is how to open them. Select this button here."
        "Script_1_Shop_5" "i made this guide for you, its called “items a first time dragon knight needs at this very second”"
        "Script_1_Shop_6" "oh very specific. Confirm that guide youngling!"
        "Script_1_Shop_7" "there you have it. Now you can just right-click on the item in your guide, and if you have the money for it the item will be bought automatically. Your gold is down in the bottom right. Congrats. I think you have enough money from murdering 3 people in the short time you arrived here, so go on ahead."
        "Script_1_Closing_1" "ok creature of mine, it's time for you to escape this hellish prison we have designed for you. Click on the item in your inventory, just like you would a spell, and then drag it over to the tree here and select it with the left mouse. Are you starting to see a pattern?"
        "Script_1_Closing_2" "i hope so"
        "Script_1_Closing_3" "you did it! Don’t ask why eating a tree is a good thing in this game, it just is. You can now escape! Go little one run before we change our minds!"
        "Script_1_Closing_4" "we are giving you back control over your camera. It's time to walk and look baby. Goodluck!"
        "Script_1_Closing_5" "did you really think we would just let you out? NO! WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF TREES!"
        "Script_1_Closing_6" "go baby infant! Follow this very not ominous path! Practice your moving and camera control! Keep in mind that you can move your camera in two ways. Number one is for cool people: where you middle click your mouse on the ground and hold it while dragging. Or you can be like my idiot mud golem brother, and move your cursor to the edge of the screen. All of this of course you can change in your game settings."
