"[english]Script_1_Opening_5" "First things first, let's take you through the main goals of the game, Defense of the Ancients."
"Script_1_Opening_6" "고대의 요새를 어떻게든 방어하는 게임일까요?"
"[english]Script_1_Opening_6" "Is it to defend the ancients by any chance?"
"Script_1_Opening_7" "아니요. 사실 게임에서 이기려면 상대의 고대 요새를 파괴해야 합니다. 우리가 괜히 여기 온게 아니라구요."
"[english]Script_1_Opening_7" "No, surprisingly, it is to kill the enemy Ancient. See, this is why you need us."
"Script_1_Opening_8" "이것은 도타 2 맵입니다. 당신이 플레이하는 장소죠. 당신은 지금 분수에 서 있습니다. 우물에서는 체력을 회복하고 영웅을 강화할 아이템을 구입할 수 있습니다."
"[english]Script_1_Opening_8" "This is the Dota 2 map, your personal battlefield. You are currently in your fountain. It will heal you and is where you can purchase items, which are power ups for your hero."
"Script_1_Opening_9" "또한 죽은 뒤에 부활하는 장소이기도 하죠. 아마 곧 겪게 될 것 같은데요."
"[english]Script_1_Opening_9" "This is also where you will respawn after you die, which I'm sure is coming up very soon."
"Script_1_Opening_10" "그리고 저기 저 멀리 있는 이것이 적 고대의 요새입니다. 당신은 이것을 파괴해야 합니다."
"[english]Script_1_Opening_10" "This, all the way over here, is the enemy ancient, this is what you are trying to destroy."
"Script_1_Opening_11" "하지만 그러기 위해서는 머나먼 길을 지나야 하지요."
"[english]Script_1_Opening_11" "But we have a long way to go before that."
"Script_1_Movement_1" "그럼, 기초 중의 기초부터. 움직이는 것부터 합시다. 마우스 커서를 저기 뻔하디 뻔한 목표 지점에 두고, 마우스 오른쪽 클릭을 눌러 그 쪽으로 이동하세요."
"[english]Script_1_Movement_1" "So, let's start off with baby steps. Let's get you to move. Move your cursor over this very generic tutorial-type waypoint and then click the right mouse button to move your hero."
"Script_1_Movement_2" "뻔하다니, 난 꽤 괜찮은데."
"[english]Script_1_Movement_2" "That’s mean, I think it looks pretty."
"Script_1_Movement_3" "그러시겠지, 너무 못생겨서 네 동생이라고 해도 될 정도인걸."
"[english]Script_1_Movement_3" "You would. Something as ugly as you would think that.. BROTHER."

"[english]Script_1_Movement_4" "Oh my goodness its first steps! SOMEONE GRAB THE CAMERA!"
"Script_1_Movement_5" "좋아요, 다음 화살표로 가 봅시다. 잠깐, 저 사람은 애니에 나온 미라나잖아! 목소리는 영 다른 것 같지만."
"[english]Script_1_Movement_5" "OK, now move on to the next arrow. Oh hey, it’s Mirana, from the anime - but with a budget voice actress!"
"Script_1_Movement_6" "사실 미라나는 매우 오래 된 영웅입니다. 초창기 도타에서부터 있었거든요."
"[english]Script_1_Movement_6" "Actually she’s a very old hero, in fact, she was in the original Dota."
"Script_1_Movement_7" "여주인공 미라나!"
"[english]Script_1_Movement_7" "Mirana from the anime!"
"Script_1_Movement_8" "아무튼, 우릴 공격하려는 것 같진 않은데. 저 화살을 조심하세요. 그녀가 날리는 화살을 이동해서 피해 보세요."
"[english]Script_1_Movement_8" "Anyway, she’s very protective of us for no particular reason. Watch out for her arrows. Just simply dodge them when she fires at you."
"Script_1_Movement_9" "안녕! 난 미라나야."
"[english]Script_1_Movement_9" "Hello! I'm Mirana."
"Script_1_Movement_9_1" "미~라나~!"

"[english]Script_1_Movement_10" "Nice dodging."
"Script_1_Movement_10_1" "화살 조심해! 이런."
"[english]Script_1_Movement_10_1" "Don't get hit! Oh."
"Script_1_Movement_10_2" "당신이었어? 정말 미안!"
"[english]Script_1_Movement_10_2" "Sorry was that you? My bad!"
"Script_1_Movement_11" "잘 하셨습니다! 걷기의 달인이라 불러도 되겠군요. 이제 좀 더 어려운 걸 해 볼까요. 당신이 움직일 수 있게 카메라를 잠금 해제했습니다. 혹시 내 위치를 찾고 싶다면, 기본 'F1'을 눌러 내 영웅으로 곧장 이동할 수 있습니다."
"[english]Script_1_Movement_11" "That's a good effort! Very good you are a real walking pro. Now, let's get to the hard stuff. I am going to unlock your camera now. If at any point you get lost, the 'F1' key will bring you back to your hero."
"Script_1_Camera_1" "잠깐, 잠깐! 어딜 가는 거야?! 이 사람 완전 흥분했는데! 괜찮으신 것 맞죠?"
"[english]Script_1_Camera_1" "Whoa whoa where are you goin'?! This guy's out of his mind! Reel it back in kiddo."
"Script_1_Camera_2" "실제 도타에서는 내 영웅과 카메라를 동시에 조작해야 하는 경우가 많습니다. 기본이지만 완벽해지긴 어렵죠. 지금은 우리가 도와줄 것입니다만, 안전한 분수 바깥의 전투에서 살아남기 위해서는 준비를 철저히 해야 합니다."
"[english]Script_1_Camera_2" "In the game of Dota, you will need to move your camera while simultaneously moving your hero to a selected spot. This is difficult to master but is step one. We will help you, but first we need to get you ready to fight if you want to survive outside of the safety of your fountain."

"Script_1_Camera_8" "어떻게 하는진 아시겠죠. 어서. 녀석을 공격하세요."
"[english]Script_1_Camera_8" "Come on you know you want to. Do it. Attack the man."

"[english]Script_1_Camera_10" "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!"
"Script_1_Leveling_1" "적을 처치해서 골드와 레벨을 획득하셨네요! 적을 처치하거나 그 근처에 있으면 경험치와 골드를 얻습니다. 경험치를 일정 이상 얻으면 레벨이 오르지요. RPG 게임들처럼 말이에요."
"[english]Script_1_Leveling_1" "Oh look at that you leveled up and got a ton of gold! Killing enemies, or just being in the general area of killed enemies allows you to gain experience and gold. Gaining experience allows you to level up, like in an RPG game."
"Script_1_Leveling_1_2" "눈치채셨겠지만, 당신은 이미 세 번째 능력인 '용의 혈통'을 배우고 있습니다. 지속 효과 능력은 지속해서 효과를 제공하지요. 이제 다른 능력을 배울 수 있습니다! 이번엔 사용 능력을 배워볼까요. '용의 꼬리' 아이콘 위의 + 버튼을 누르세요."
"[english]Script_1_Leveling_1_2" "As you can see, you were already provided your third skill, Dragon Blood, which is a passive, meaning it just works. Now, you can select another skill! Let’s have you select an active ability. Click on the plus sign over Dragon Tail."
"Script_1_Leveling_2" "언제든지 능력 아이콘 위에 커서를 올려 세부 사항을 확인해보세요. 그렇다고 대놓고 상대 앞에서 그러지는 말고요. 부끄럽잖아요. 그리고 도타 메인 메뉴에 있는 영웅 탭에서도 능력을 확인해 볼 수 있습니다."
"[english]Script_1_Leveling_2" "Feel free to hover over your skills at any time, to learn more about them. Probably best not to do this during the game though as other people might laugh at you. You can also read up on all the hero skills in the heroes tab, which is in the main menu of Dota."
"Script_1_Leveling_3" "오 이런, 퍼그나가 옵니다. 엄청 귀찮은 녀석이죠."
"[english]Script_1_Leveling_3" "Oh no, here comes Pugna. He's so annoying."
"Script_1_Leveling_4" "안녕하세요. 퍼그나입니다. 오늘은 힘, 민첩, 지능의 차이점에 대해서 이야기해보려고 합니다..."
"[english]Script_1_Leveling_4" "Yellow everybody this is Pugna and I'm here to talk to you today about the difference between strength, agility, and intelligence."

"[english]Script_1_Leveling_5" "Oh no, make him stop! Use your ability! Press the 'W' key or hover over the icon and then select the skill that you'd like to use. Then hover the mouse over the enemy unit and left click them."
"Script_1_Leveling_6" "영웅은 적이 능력 사거리에 닿는 위치까지 이동한 뒤, 자동으로 능력을 시전합니다!"
"[english]Script_1_Leveling_6" "Your hero will automatically walk toward the enemy until the spell is in casting range, and then they will automatically cast it!"
"Script_1_Leveling_7" "부탁이니 방해하지 마세요."
"[english]Script_1_Leveling_7" "Please don’t interrupt me."

"Script_1_Leveling_10" "'용의 꼬리'는 대상 지정 능력입니다. 범위 내 적 유닛을 선택해 그 유닛을 대상으로 능력을 시전하지요. 반면 '불꽃 숨결'은 지점 지정 능력입니다. 맵의 원하는 지점을 선택해 그 방향으로 능력을 사용합니다."
"[english]Script_1_Leveling_10" "Your Dragon Tail is a single target ability, meaning you can target an enemy and it will cast it on them, as long as you are in range. Breathe Fire on the other hand, is a target point ability, meaning you can target a point, like a place on the map, but not a specific unit."
"Script_1_BreatheFire_1" "잠깐, 왜 나한테도 체력바가 떠 있는 거지?"
"[english]Script_1_BreatheFire_1" "Wait, why do I have a health bar?"
"Script_1_BreatheFire_2" "이제 네가 당할 차례야, 친구. 다음은 무엇인지 아시겠죠? 'Q' 키나 아이콘을 눌러 불꽃 숨결 능력을 선택한 후, 땅을 왼쪽 클릭해 원하는 방향으로 능력을 시전하세요."
"[english]Script_1_BreatheFire_2" "It’s your turn, dear brother. you know what to do young one. Press 'Q', aka your Breathe Fire ability, or simply select it with your mouse, then click on the ground with the left mouse button in the direction you want to cast."

"Script_1_BreatheFire_4" "으아아악 뜨거워... 이제 나도 귀신이 된 거 같네요."
"[english]Script_1_BreatheFire_4" "AHHHH IT BURNS...welp guess we are both ghosts now."
"Script_1_BreatheFire_5" "그래 둘 다 유령이지, 이제 당신을 평생 뒤쫓을 유령 말이에요. 아 실제 도타에서는 적을 죽인다고 유령이 들러붙거나 하진 않습니다. 또 어떤 게 들러붙는지 알고 싶다고요? 상점 메뉴 버튼을 눌러보세요!"
"[english]Script_1_BreatheFire_5" "Yes both ghosts, here to haunt you for eternity. Just keep in mind that this is NOT in a normal dota game. You will not be haunted by ghosts I promise. You know what else will haunt you? Hit the shop button!"
"Script_1_Shop_1" "아이템이 너무 많아! 내 눈!"
"[english]Script_1_Shop_1" "Oh my god there are so many items! MY EYES!"
"Script_1_Shop_2" "아이템이야말로 이 게임이 깊은 전략성을 가지는 이유라고 할 수 있죠. 영웅은 저마다의 장단점을 가지고 있습니다. 아이템은 그 장점을 더욱 강화하거나 약점을 보완하는 역할을 하지요."
"[english]Script_1_Shop_2" "Items are one of the many reasons this game is so deep. A hero by default, will be good at a specific thing depending on who you pick. But items allow you to change them to excel in areas they may not be able to normally."
"Script_1_Shop_3" "몇몇 아이템은 영웅의 플레이 스타일을 천차만별로 변화시킵니다. 도타가 가위바위보라고 생각하면, 보통은 바위가 가위를 이기지만, 적절한 아이템 빌드를 통해 가위가 바위를 어느 정도 이길 수 있는 셈이죠."
"[english]Script_1_Shop_3" "Certain items can allow you to open up completely different playstyles for your heroes. Think of Dota heroes as rock, paper, scissors. Rock will always beat scissors, but in Dota, scissors can specifically build itself to be a little better against rock, should the need arise."
"Script_1_Shop_4" "걱정하지 마세요. 모든 영웅마다 유저들이 손수 제작한 아이템 길잡이가 있거든요. 잠깐 게임 내에서 어떻게 길잡이를 사용하는지 보여주겠습니다. 당신이 좋다고 생각하는 길잡이를 선택한 후, 확인 버튼을 누르세요."
"[english]Script_1_Shop_4" "Don't worry my friend. Every single hero has a guide that the community made which will tell you with items to buy on them. This is a little video that will show you how to do this in game. Select a guide-maker that you like and trust, and select their guide and confirm them."
"Script_1_Shop_5" "말이 나온 김에, 이 시나리오 전용 가이드를 미리 만들어 뒀습니다. 한번 믿어 보시라구요."
"[english]Script_1_Shop_5" "Speaking of which, I made you a guide to get out of this exact scenario right now. You can trust me... trust me."
"Script_1_Shop_7" "여기 보다시피 골드만 충분하면 제 길잡이에 등록된 아이템을 클릭으로 바로 살 수 있지요. 많고 많은 아이템 목록을 뒤질 필요도 없고요. 현재 골드는 오른 쪽 아래에 표시됩니다. 놀랍게도 여기 온 지 얼마 되지도 않았는데 벌써 3명을 처치하고 골드를 많이 모으셨네요! 이제 모은 돈으로 '목담과'를 사 보세요."
"[english]Script_1_Shop_7" "Now as you can see in my guide we have items here and you can just click on them if you have enough gold. You don't have to find them in the big shop list. Your gold is down in the bottom right. Congratulations! I think you have enough money from murdering 3 people in the very short time you've arrived here, so go ahead and buy that Tango."
"Script_1_Closing_1" "좋아요. 이제 우리가 만든 이 지옥 같은 감옥을 빠져나갑시다. 보관함의 아이템을 클릭하고, 그 다음 나무를 선택합니다. 주문이랑 똑같아요. 간단하죠?"
"[english]Script_1_Closing_1" "OK creature of mine, it's time for you to escape this hellish prison we have designed for you. Click on the item in your inventory, just like you would a spell, and then click select one of the trees. Are you starting to see a pattern?"
"Script_1_Closing_2" "정말 간단하지."
"[english]Script_1_Closing_2" "Yeah, I hope so."
"Script_1_Closing_3" "해냈군요! 왜 나무를 먹어야 회복이 되는 건지는 묻지 맙시다. 그냥 그러려니 하세요. 이제 여길 빠져나갑시다! 어서! 우리 마음이 바뀌기 전에요."
"[english]Script_1_Closing_3" "You did it! Don’t ask why eating a tree is a good thing in this game, it just is. You can now escape! Go little one run before we change our minds!"
"Script_1_Closing_4" "이제 다시 당신에게 카메라 조종권을 넘기겠습니다. 마음껏 둘러보십시오. 행운을 빕니다!"
"[english]Script_1_Closing_4" "We are going to give you back control over your camera. It's time to walk and look baby. Good luck!"
"Script_1_Closing_5" "정말로 그냥 나가실 수 있다고 생각하셨나요? 땡! 장벽 수백 개로 막혔거든요!"
"[english]Script_1_Closing_5" "Did you really think we would just let you out? NO! WE HAVE THOUSANDS OF BARRIERS."
"General_Scared" "*으악*"
"[english]General_Scared" "*Scared*"
"Script_1_Closing_6" "아기가 걸음마를 떼듯이! 계속 목표를 따라 이동해요! 이동과 카메라 조종을 연습하는 겁니다! 그러고 보니 카메라를 조종하는 방법은 두 가지가 있는 걸 알려드려야겠군요."
"[english]Script_1_Closing_6" "Go baby infant! Follow this very not ominous path! Practice your moving and camera control! Keep in mind that you can move your camera in two ways."
"Script_1_Closing_6_2" "첫 번째로는 저처럼 멋진 사람을 위한 마우스 휠을 누른 채로 드래그하는 방법이죠. 아니면 제 옆의 멍청이 그리빌 형씨처럼 화면 가장자리에 커서를 이동해도 되고요. 두 가지 방법은 게임 설정에서 고르실 수 있습니다."
"[english]Script_1_Closing_6_2" "Number one is for cool people: where you middle click your mouse on the ground and hold it while dragging. Or you can be like my idiot greevil brother, and move your cursor to the edge of the screen. All of this of course you can change in your game settings."
"Script_2_Opening_1" "마침내 도착했군요. 래디언트 상부 병영에 오신 것을 환영합니다. 기지의 각 건물들은 제각각 세워진 이유와 목적이 다르죠."
"[english]Script_2_Opening_1" "And here we are. Welcome to the top radiant barracks. Before you lay several buildings each with their own purpose and destiny."
"Script_2_Opening_2" "저기 저 녀석은 말고요. 달샘처럼 생긴 거 말이에요."
"[english]Script_2_Opening_2" "Except for that one there. That’s a Moon Well."
"Script_2_Opening_3" "그냥 장식이죠. 그래도 꽤 멋지게 생기지 않았습니까? 전 그런거 같은데요."
"[english]Script_2_Opening_3" "Yes that is just there to look cool. Do you think it's cool? I do."
"Script_2_Opening_4" "아주 좋아요. 병영은 오른쪽이 근접 병영, 왼쪽이 원거리 병영입니다. 두 병영은 크립을 소환하지요!"
"[english]Script_2_Opening_4" "Very good. So, to your right you can see the Melee Barracks, and to the left you see the Ranged Barracks. These two buildings spawn creeps!"
"Script_2_Opening_5" "크립이라고 저그 해처리가 까는 장판 같은 건 아니고요. 크립은... 크립을 뭐라고 설명해야 하지?"
"[english]Script_2_Opening_5" "Don't worry, not creeps like people that have bodypillows. Creeps like... uh... what are the creeps like?"
"Script_2_Opening_6" "크립은 매 30초마다 생성되며, 전선이라고 불리는 경로를 따라 이동합니다. 크립을 조종할 수 없으며, 전선을 따라 마주치는 모든 적을 공격하는 단 하나의 명령만을 수행합니다. 적 영웅, 건물, 그리고 인성질을 가리지 않지요!"
"[english]Script_2_Opening_6" "The creeps spawn every 30 seconds and walk down the path ahead of them, called a lane. The creeps are uncontrollable and have one mission, to mindlessly walk down the path and attack any enemy they come in contact with. This includes enemy heroes, buildings, or emotions!"
"Script_2_Opening_7" "그래요. 크립은 당신을 위한 고기방패라고 할 수 있습니다. 적 영웅이 함부로 당신에게 다가가지 못하는 역할을 하지요. 지역을 침범했다간 크립에게 다구리를 당할 테니까요."
"[english]Script_2_Opening_7" "That's right. The creeps act as your cannon fodder, making sure that the enemy can't just go to your side of the map and hurt you, or they will be stabbed by a thousand little swords."
"Script_2_Opening_8" "병영은 크립을 생성하는 역할을 하지만, 적 크립을 파괴한다고 크립이 더 생성되지 않거나 하진 않습니다. 언뜻 말이 안되는 것 같지만 이 게임이 다 그런 걸요. 세 전선에 병영이 각각 한 쌍씩 존재합니다. 위치에 따라 상부, 중부, 하부로 나뉘지요."
"[english]Script_2_Opening_8" "These Barracks are what spawn these creeps, so as you can imagine if you destroy the enemy’s Barracks, then your creeps become stronger. That may not make sense, but that’s just how Dota is. There is one set of barracks in each of the three lanes. These lanes are referred to as Top, Middle, and Bottom."
"Script_2_Opening_9" "적 병영을 파괴한다고 크립이 더 이상 생성되지 않거나 하진 않습니다. 적 크립은 계속 생성됩니다만, 병영이 파괴된 전선의 내 크립이 더욱 강력해집니다. 한 전선의 병영을 파괴하면 우수 크립이 되고, 모든 병영을 파괴하면 상급 크립이 되죠! 여기 상급 크립이 일반 크립에 비해 얼마나 더 강력한지 보실까요."
"[english]Script_2_Opening_9" "Now, if you destroy the Barracks, the enemy creeps don't just stop spawning. They continue to spawn, but your creeps get stronger in each lane that lacks an enemy Barracks. Take one lane and you'll get SUPER creeps. And if you take all of the lanes, you get MEGA creeps. Check out how different the creeps are and how much more powerful they get as they murder these poor innocent heroes."
"Script_2_Opening_9_1" "이 상급크립 녀석들 아주 제대론데요!"
"[english]Script_2_Opening_9_1" "That mega creep don't mess around!"
"Script_2_Opening_10" "Indeed! Think of Dota like this: killing other players allows you to have time to hit their buildings while they respawn. Hitting buildings is the true goal of dota, for when there are no buildings the enemy ancient is exposed. The game in a nutshell is essentially an elaborate tug of war where both sides try to outpush the other."
